# AddressBook
Simple address book application in C++ for class at Thomas Edison State University. Assignment asked for an application that had an addressbook to store names in a linked list. Linked list was pre-loaded with names from a file (also to demonstrate file input and name extraction). Basic menu options in the program allow adding/removing list elements, changing birthdays, anniversaries, and producing birthday/anniversary cards if a date matches system's today date.

## Summary
A basic AddressBook class was created to instantiate each memeber of the list. I also created a Birthday class and Anniversary class to hold those dates in a format that allowed for overloading of operators for easy comparison and manipulation.

## Built With
CLion was used to write the code and compile the program
